# Project 2
**Automation of Concrete Mix Design**
--------------------------------------
This Python Programming Assignment 2 is to share between classmates
(Nay Law Eh Htoo, Abdi Aden, and Hunter Anciaux) and the professor.
## Purpose
This project aims to automate the NDOT concrete mix design process by converting Excel-based logic into a functional Python program. We will create a code that prompts users to input design variables, such as cement content and air content. The program will use the absolute volume method to accurately calculate a weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete. To validate the tool's reliability, we will research and run four realistic engineering scenarios through the program to verify that the Python output aligns with the clients prompt.

## Content
* Read Me file (summary of project 2)
* Project 2 - Phython Code file (Code has 5 parts: Setup, Calculation Function, Sequential User Inputs, Running Complete Mix Design, and Running Scenarios)
  - Run each section (Parts 1- 5) of the code until it prompts the user for input, for example.
  - Inputs: 
  - Enter project number:  1 
  - Enter control number:  123
  - Enter class of concrete (e.g., 47B, 47BR):  47B
  - Enter cement weight A (lb per cubic yard):  564.0
  - Enter fly ash weight B (lb per cubic yard):  0
  - Enter silica fume weight C (lb per cubic yard):  0
  - Enter other SCM weight D (lb per cubic yard):  0
  - Enter target water-cement ratio E:  0.45
  - Enter target air content F (%):  6.0
  - Enter percent fine aggregate G (%):  30.0
  - Enter percent coarse aggregate H (%):  70.0
  - Enter percent other aggregate I (%):  0
  - Enter specific gravity of cement J:  3.15
  - Enter specific gravity of fly ash K:  2.30
  - Enter specific gravity of silica fume L:  2.20
  - Enter specific gravity of other SCM M:  2.90
  - Enter specific gravity of fine aggregate N:  2.62
  - Enter specific gravity of coarse aggregate O:  2.65
  - Enter specific gravity of other aggregate P:  2.65
    
  - After entering input, run the rest of the code. It will automatically do the calculations, give the user a clearly formatted weight chart for one cubic yard of     concrete and Scenario calculations clearly formatted.
