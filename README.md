# Project 2
**Automation of Concrete Mix Design**
--------------------------------------
This Python Programming Assignment 2 is to share between classmates
(Nay Law Eh Htoo, Abdi Aden, and Hunter Anciaux) and professor
## Purpose
This project aims to automate the NDOT concrete mix design process by converting Excel-based logic into a functional Python program. We will create a code that prompts users to input design variables, such as cement content and air content. The program will use the absolute volume method to accurately calculate a weight chart for one cubic yard of concrete. To validate the tool's reliability, we will research and run four realistic engineering scenarios through the program to verify that the Python output aligns with the clients prompt.
